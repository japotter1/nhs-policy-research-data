Data analysis for NHS policy research

NOTE: In order for the script "Appraisal_Equity_Map_Workflow_Abridged.Rmd" to run, you MUST download the FHFA UAD tract dataset from this link: https://www.fhfa.gov/DataTools/Pages/UAD-Dashboards.aspx (the option labeled "Census Tracts" in the "Datasets" table; click the link to download it as a csv).

This file must be renamed "FHFA_UAD_tract.csv" and placed in a directory named "FHFA_UAD_tract". The "FHFA_UAD_tract" directory must then be placed in the same directory as the script, or wherever you set the working directory.
