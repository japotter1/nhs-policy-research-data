## Map: Race, Income, and Appraisal Value in Illinois

An appraisal is the process by which a lender determines the value of a home. Bias often enters this process when appraisers undervalue homes due to the race of the current homeowner or their neighbors, preventing homebuyers from receiving loans large enough to cover the contract price of a house.

In this analysis, appraisal equity in Illinois is evaluated through the use of several key variables from the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) Uniform Appraisal Dataset (UAD), such as:

-   The percentage of appraisal values that are below the contract price in each tract (an unfavorable outcome for a consumer).
-   The percentage of appraisal values that are above the contract price in each tract (a favorable outcome for a consumer). This allows us not only to show who is losing out, but who is benefiting from inequities in the appraisal process.
-   The count of home purchase appraisals per year (averaged) in each tract.

Demographic data from the US Census Bureau are also included for comparison.

Please note that FHFA data were suppressed for about 23% of census tracts due to privacy concerns, and thus these tracts are not included in this analysis.

### Extracting data

#### Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) Uniform Appraisal Dataset (UAD)

Data from the UAD are downloaded from the [**FHFA datasets page**](https://www.fhfa.gov/DataTools/Pages/UAD-Dashboards.aspx). Tract-level data are used to show differences in appraisal values between local areas.

After data are downloaded, the following operations are done to reduce the size and increase the relevance of the dataset:

1.  Only tracts in Illinois, the study area, are included.
2.  Only data from 2018 onward are included (to allow for averaging later).
3.  Only data on home purchases (rather than refinancing) are included.
4.  Unnecessary variables are dropped.
5.  A 5-year average, from 2018 to 2022 (inclusive), is taken to show the most recent appraisal data, while also ensuring that a long enough period is used to reduce noise.

Note that the following code chunk is not run in this R Markdown (hence the `#` before each line) in order to save time, as the output file only must be created once.

```{r 1}
## Load data, filter data, and drop unnecessary variables -- COMMENTED, AS THIS ONLY NEEDS TO BE RUN ONCE
#rawdata = read.csv("FHFA_UAD_tract/FHFA_UAD_tract.csv") %>%
#  filter(STATEPOSTAL == "IL" & YEAR >= 2018 & PURPOSE == "Purchase") %>%
#  select(SERIES, GEOID = TRACT, YEAR, VALUE)

## Rename series
#varnms = data.frame(SERIES = unique(rawdata$SERIES), varnm = paste0("raw_", c("ctapr", "mdapr", "q1apr", "q3apr", #"mnapr", "mnrat", "pctbw", "pcteq", "pctab")))

#rawdata = rawdata %>% merge(varnms, ., by = "SERIES") %>% select(-SERIES)

## Divide into separate tables
#list2env(split(rawdata, rawdata$varnm), envir = .GlobalEnv)

## Take 5-year average of each variable
## (NOTE - This unfortunately did not work in a for loop, so each must be run individually, as seen below)
#raw_ctapr = raw_ctapr %>% select(-varnm) %>%

#  group_by(GEOID) %>%
#  summarise(q1apr = mean(VALUE, na.rm = T)) %>%
#  mutate_at(vars(q1apr), ~ifelse(is.nan(.), NA, .))
#raw_q3apr = raw_q3apr %>% select(-varnm) %>%

#raw_pctbw = raw_pctbw %>% select(-varnm) %>%
#  group_by(GEOID) %>%
#  summarise(pctbw = mean(VALUE, na.rm = T)) %>%
#  mutate_at(vars(pctbw), ~ifelse(is.nan(.), NA, .))
#raw_pcteq = raw_pcteq %>% select(-varnm) %>%
#  group_by(GEOID) %>%
#  summarise(pcteq = mean(VALUE, na.rm = T)) %>%
#  mutate_at(vars(pcteq), ~ifelse(is.nan(.), NA, .))
#raw_pctab = raw_pctab %>% select(-varnm) %>%
#  group_by(GEOID) %>%
#  summarise(pctab = mean(VALUE, na.rm = T)) %>%
#  mutate_at(vars(pctab), ~ifelse(is.nan(.), NA, .))

## Merge all nine tables back together
#table_list = list(raw_ctapr, raw_mdapr, raw_q1apr, raw_q3apr, raw_mnapr, raw_mnrat, raw_pctbw, raw_pcteq, raw_pctab)
#cleandata = reduce(table_list, full_join, by="GEOID")

## Export as a .csv
#write.csv(cleandata, "FHFA_UAD_tract/FHFA_UAD_tract_filtered.csv")
```

The following code chunk simply opens up the file created above, removes an unnecessary index variable, and converts the `GEOID` variable (census tract code) to string format to allow for merging with census data later on.

```{r 1.1}
# Load cleaned CSV created above and remove the index variable
fhfa_uad_trct = read.csv("FHFA_UAD_tract/FHFA_UAD_tract_filtered.csv") %>%
  select(-X)

# Change GEOID to character data type in order to allow for merging later on
class(fhfa_uad_trct$GEOID) = "character"
```

#### 2020 census data

2020 census data on population and race are downloaded directly from the census bureau using the [**tidycensus**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidycensus/index.html) R package. Variables fro the 2020 Decennial Census are **total population** (`P1_001N`), **total non-Hispanic/Latino white population** (`P2_005N`), **total Hispanic/Latino population** (`P2_002N`), and **total non-Hispanic/Latino Black population** (`P2_006N`). One final variable, **median income** (`B19326_001`), is taken from a 5-year average of the American Community Survey from 2017-2021 (inclusive).

```{r 2, results='hide'}
# Load decennial variables
il_trct_dec = get_decennial(
  geography = "tract",
  variables = c(popul = "P1_001N", white = "P2_005N", hispa = "P2_002N", black = "P2_006N"),
  state = "IL",
  year = 2020,
  geometry = T,
  output = "wide"
) %>%
  filter(!st_is_empty(geometry)) # REMOVE EMPTY TRACTS!

# Load ACS variable
il_trct_acs = get_acs(
  geography = "tract",
  variables = c(mdinc = "B19326_001"),
  state = "IL",
  year = 2021,
  survey = "acs5",
  geometry = T,
  output = "wide"
) %>%
  filter(!st_is_empty(geometry)) %>% # REMOVE EMPTY TRACTS!
  st_drop_geometry() %>% # REMOVE GEOMETRY (ALREADY PROVIDED FROM DECENNIAL VARIABLES)
  select(GEOID, mdinc = mdincE) # REMOVE OTHER UNNECESSARY VARIABLES
```

### Transforming data

First, the census tables and appraisal data are merged.

```{r 3}
# Merge tables
il_trct = full_join(il_trct_dec, il_trct_acs, by = "GEOID") %>%
  full_join(fhfa_uad_trct, by = "GEOID")
```

Next, a new variable is created to calculate the mean difference between contract price and appraisal price in USD for each census tract. This will show the monetary loss or gain faced by the average homebuyer from the appraisal process in that census tract.

```{r 3.1}
il_trct$mndif = il_trct$mnapr-(il_trct$mnapr*il_trct$mnrat)
```

Next, each race variable is converted to a percent of the total tract population, then all percentage variables are multiplied by 100 (this is needed in order to visualize the values as a percentage later on).

```{r 4}
# Calculate percentages, then multiply these values and pctbw by 100
il_trct = il_trct %>% mutate_at(vars(c(white, hispa, black)), ~ (./popul)) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(c(white, hispa, black, pctbw, pcteq, pctab)), ~ (.*100))
```

To clean up, non-integer values are rounded and variables are relocated in a more sensible order.

```{r 5}
# Round non-integer values
il_trct$white = round(il_trct$white, digits = 1)
il_trct$hispa = round(il_trct$hispa, digits = 1)
il_trct$black = round(il_trct$black, digits = 1)
il_trct$ctapr = round(il_trct$ctapr, digits = 1)
il_trct$mdapr = round(il_trct$mdapr, digits = 0)
il_trct$q1apr = round(il_trct$q1apr, digits = 0)
il_trct$q3apr = round(il_trct$q3apr, digits = 0)
il_trct$mnapr = round(il_trct$mnapr, digits = 0)
il_trct$mnrat = round(il_trct$mnrat, digits = 3)
il_trct$pctbw = round(il_trct$pctbw, digits = 1)
il_trct$pcteq = round(il_trct$pcteq, digits = 1)
il_trct$pctab = round(il_trct$pctab, digits = 1)
il_trct$mndif = round(il_trct$mndif, digits = 0)

# Rearrange variables
il_trct = il_trct %>%
  relocate(geometry, .after = mndif)
```

Finally, alternate versions of this table are created, the first with no `NA` values, and the second with no `NA` and only positive values that is converted to logarithmic format (the mean difference variable is dropped, as it is frequently negative). The first will allow for better map visualizations, while the second will allow for linear regressions with logarithmic transformation.

```{r 6}
# No NA values
il_trct_noNA = na.omit(il_trct)

# No NA or 0 values - logarithmic transformation (mndif variable dropped)
il_trct_log = il_trct_noNA %>% select(-mndif) %>%
  filter(popul > 0 & white > 0 & hispa > 0 & black > 0 & pctbw > 0 & pcteq > 0 & pctab > 0) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(white, hispa, black, mdinc, ctapr, mdapr, q1apr, q3apr, mnapr, mnrat, pctbw, pcteq, pctab), ~ log(.))
```

### Mapping data

In order to create interactive maps, package [**tmap**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/index.html) is set to interactive viewing mode and labels with percentage and dollar symbols are created.

```{r 7}
# Set tmap to interactive viewing
tmap_mode("view")

# Create "%" and "$" string variables for labeling
il_trct_noNA = il_trct_noNA %>%
  mutate(white_pct = paste0(sprintf("%.1f", white), "%")) %>%
  mutate(hispa_pct = paste0(sprintf("%.1f", hispa), "%")) %>%
  mutate(black_pct = paste0(sprintf("%.1f", black), "%")) %>%
  mutate(mdinc_usd = paste0("$", as.character(format(mdinc, big.mark = ",", trim = T)))) %>%
  mutate(pctbw_pct = paste0(sprintf("%.1f", pctbw), "%")) %>%
  mutate(pctab_pct = paste0(sprintf("%.1f", pctab), "%")) %>%
  mutate(mndif_usd = paste0("$", as.character(format(mndif, big.mark = ",", trim = T))))
```

Next, the maps are defined as an object, using data from the "no NA" version of the data table. This object is then converted to a [**leaflet**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/leaflet/index.html) map in order to change a few settings.

```{r 8}
# Create popup label object
popup = c("2020 Population" = "popul", "2020 Percent Non-Hispanic/Latino White" = "white_pct", "2020 Percent Non-Hispanic/Latino Black" = "black_pct", "2020 Percent Hispanic/Latino" = "hispa_pct", "2017-2021 Median Income" = "mdinc_usd", "2018-2022 Annual Count of Appraisals" = "ctapr", "2018-2022 Percent of Appraisals Below Contract Price" = "pctbw_pct", "2018-2022 Percent of Appraisals Above Contract Price" = "pctab_pct", "2018-2022 Mean Appraisal Loss/Gain" = "mndif_usd")
